vii</span>DEDICATION</h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">TO COVENTRY
PATMORE</span></p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Lo</span>, my book thinks
to look Time&rsquo;s leaguer down,<br />
Under the banner of your spread renown!<br />
Or if these levies of impuissant rhyme<br />
Fall to the overthrow of assaulting Time,<br />
Yet this one page shall fend oblivious shame,<br />
Armed with your crested and prevailing Name.</p>
<p><i>Note</i>.&mdash;This dedication was written while the dear
friend and great Poet to whom it was addressed yet lived.&nbsp;
It is left as he saw it&mdash;the last verses of mine that were
ever to pass under his eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align: right" class="poetry"><span

<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>SIGHT
AND INSIGHT</h2>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Wisdom is easily seen by them that love
her, and is found by them that seek her.<br />
To think therefore upon her is perfect understanding.&rsquo;</p>

<h3><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>THE
MISTRESS OF VISION.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">I</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
class="smcap">Secret</span> was the garden;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set i&rsquo; the pathless awe<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where no star its breath can
draw.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Life, that is its warden,<br />
Sits behind the fosse of death.&nbsp; Mine eyes saw not, and I
saw.</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">II</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a
mazeful wonder;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thrice three times it was
enwalled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With an emerald&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seal&egrave;d so asunder.<br />
All its birds in middle air hung a-dream, their music
thralled.</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry"><a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>III</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lady of
fair weeping,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the garden&rsquo;s core,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sang a song of sweet and sore<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the after-sleeping;<br />
In the land of Luthany, and the tracts of Elenore.</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">IV</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
sweet-panged singing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sang she through a
dream-night&rsquo;s day;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That the bowers might stay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Birds bate their winging,<br />
Nor the wall of emerald float in wreath&egrave;d haze away.</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">V</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lily
kept its gleaming,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her tears (divine
conservers!)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wash&egrave;d with sad art;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the flowers of dreaming<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pal&egrave;d not their
fervours,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For her blood flowed through their
nervures;<br />
And the roses were most red, for she dipt them in her heart.</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry"><a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>VI</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was
never moon,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Save the white sufficing woman:<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Light most
heavenly-human&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the unseen form of sound,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sensed invisibly in
tune,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a sun-deriv&egrave;d stole<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did inaureole<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All her lovely body round;<br />
Lovelily her lucid body with that light was interstrewn.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">VII</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun
which lit that garden wholly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Low and vibrant visible,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tempered glory woke;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it seem&egrave;d solely<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a silver thurible<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solemnly swung, slowly,<br />
Fuming clouds of golden fire, for a cloud of incense-smoke.</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry"><a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>VIII</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But
woe&rsquo;s me, and woe&rsquo;s me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the secrets of her eyes!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my visions fearfully<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are ever shown to be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As fring&egrave;d pools, whereof
each lies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pallid-dark beneath the skies<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of a night that is<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But one blear necropolis.<br />
And her eyes a little tremble, in the wind of her own sighs.</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">IX</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many
changes rise on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their phantasmal mysteries.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They grow to an horizon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where earth and heaven meet;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And like a wing that dies on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vague twilight-verges,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many a sinking dream doth fleet<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lessening down their secrecies.<br

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">This</span> morning saw I,
fled the shower,<br />
The earth reclining in a lull of power:<br />
The heavens, pursuing not their path,<br />
Lay stretched out naked after bath,<br />
Or so it seemed; field, water, tree, were still,<br />
Nor was there any purpose on the calm-browed hill.</p>
<p class="poetry">The hill, which sometimes visibly is<br />
Wrought with unresting energies,<br />
Looked idly; from the musing wood,<br />
And every rock, a life renewed<br />
Exhaled like an unconscious thought<br />
When poets, dreaming unperplexed,<br />
Dream that they dream of nought.<br />
Nature one hour appears a thing unsexed,<br />
Or to such serene balance brought<br />
<a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>That her
twin natures cease their sweet alarms,<br />
And sleep in one another&rsquo;s arms.<br />

And slacken its command upon my unurged blood.</p>
<p class="poetry">The river has not any care<br />
Its passionless water to the sea to bear;<br />
The leaves have brown content;<br />
The wall to me has freshness like a scent,<br />
And takes half animate the air,<br />
Making one life with its green moss and stain;<br />
And life with all things seems too perfect blent<br />
For anything of life to be aware.<br />
The very shades on hill, and tree, and plain,<br />
Where they have fallen doze, and where they doze remain.</p>
<p class="poetry">No hill can idler be than I;<br />
No stone its inter-particled vibration<br />
Investeth with a stiller lie;<br />
No heaven with a more urgent rest betrays<br />
The eyes that on it gaze.<br />

Me, Nature, with thy fair deceit.</p>

Upon the bosom of the glassy hour,<br />

Too instant, too entire for sense thereof,<br />
Motion like gnats when autumn suns are low,<br />
Perpetual as the prisoned feet of love<br />
On the heart&rsquo;s floors with pain&egrave;d pace that go.<br

From stones and poets you may know,<br />
Nothing so active is, as that which least seems so.</p>

Till, all containing, he exalt<br />
His stature to the stars, or stars<br />
Narrow their heaven to his fleshly vault:<br />
When, like a city under ocean,<br />

And is made a habitation<br />

His mind more still is than the limbs of fear,<br />
And yet its unperturbed velocity<br />
The spirit of the simoom mocks.<br />
He round the solemn centre of his soul<br />
Wheels like a dervish, while his being is<br />
Streamed with the set of the world&rsquo;s harmonies,<br />
In the long draft of whatsoever sphere<br />
He lists the sweet and clear<br />
Clangour of his high orbit on to roll,<br />
So gracious is his heavenly grace;<br />
And the bold stars does hear,<br />
Every one in his airy soar,<br />
For evermore<br />
Shout to each other from the peaks of space,<br />
As thwart ravines of azure shouts the mountaineer.</p>

Confounds all ray&mdash;<br />
But only stand aside and grieve;<br />
I yet have sight beyond the smoke,<br />
And kiss the gods&rsquo; feet, though they wreak<br />
Upon me stroke and again stroke;<br />
And this my seeing is not weak.<br />
The Woman I behold, whose vision seek<br />
All eyes and know not; t&rsquo;ward whom climb<br />
<a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>The steps
o&rsquo; the world, and beats all wing of rhyme,<br />
And knows not; &rsquo;twixt the sun and moon<br />
Her inexpressible front enstarred<br />
Tempers the wrangling spheres to tune;<br />
Their divergent harmonies<br />
Concluded in the concord of her eyes,<br />
And vestal dances of her glad regard.<br />
I see, which fretteth with surmise<br />
Much heads grown unsagacious-grey,<br />
The slow aim of wise-hearted Time,<br />
Which folded cycles within cycles cloak:<br />
We pass, we pass, we pass; this does not pass away,<br />
But holds the furrowing earth still harnessed to its yoke.<br />
The stars still write their golden purposes<br />
On heaven&rsquo;s high palimpsest, and no man sees,<br />
Nor any therein Daniel; I do hear<br />
From the revolving year<br />
A voice which cries:<br />
&lsquo;All dies;<br />
Lo, how all dies!&nbsp; O seer,<br />
And all things too arise:<br />
<a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>All dies,
and all is born;<br />
But each resurgent morn, behold, more near the Perfect
Morn.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Firm is the man, and set beyond the cast<br />
Of Fortune&rsquo;s game, and the iniquitous hour,<br />
Whose falcon soul sits fast,<br />
And not intends her high sagacious tour<br />
Or ere the quarry sighted; who looks past<br />
To slow much sweet from little instant sour,<br />
And in the first does always see the last.</p>

sung<br />
Much song of matters vain,<br />
And a heaven-sweetened tongue<br />
Turned to unprofiting strain<br />

It is no boot at all for thee to know,<br />
But babble and false pain.</p>

And nothing well devised.</p>

He calleth by its name,<br />
Lest that its bright feet stray;<br />
And thou have lore of all,<br />
But to thine own Sun&rsquo;s call<br />
Thy path disorbed hast never wit to tame;<br />
It profits not withal,<br />
And my rede is but lame.</p>

Of wisdom ignorant,<br />

Not wholly missed near sweet, fanning proud plumes above.</p>

Poised in our quiet being; only, only<br />

<p class="poetry">In nescientness, in nescientness,<br />
Mother, we put these fleshly lendings on<br />
Thou yield&rsquo;st to thy poor children; took thy gift<br />
Of life, which must, in all the after-days,<br />
Be craved again with tears,&mdash;<br />
With fresh and still-petitionary tears.<br />
Being once bound thine almsmen for that gift,<br />
We are bound to beggary, nor our own can call<br />
The journal dole of customary life,<br />
But after suit obsequious for&rsquo;t to thee.<br />
Indeed this flesh, O Mother,<br />
A beggar&rsquo;s gown, a client&rsquo;s badging,<br />
We find, which from thy hands we simply took,<br />
Nought dreaming of the after penury,<br />
In nescientness.</p>
<p class="poetry">In a little joy, in a little joy,<br />

Then what use knew I of thy solemn robes,<br />
But as a child, to play with them?&nbsp; I bade thee<br />
Leave thy great husbandries, thy grave designs,<br />
Thy tedious state which irked my ignorant years,<br />
Thy winter-watches, suckling of the grain,<br />
Severe premeditation taciturn<br />
Upon the brooded Summer, thy chill cares,<br />
And all thy ministries majestical,<br />
To sport with me, thy darling.&nbsp; Thought I not<br />
Thou set&rsquo;st thy seasons forth processional<br />
To pamper me with pageant,&mdash;thou thyself<br />
My fellow-gamester, appanage of mine arms?<br />
Then what wild Dionysia I, young Bacchanal,<br />
Danced in thy lap!&nbsp; Ah for thy gravity!<br />
Then, O Earth, thou rang&rsquo;st beneath me,<br />
Rocked to Eastward, rocked to Westward,<br />
Even with the shifted<br />
Poise and footing of my thought!<br />
I brake through thy doors of sunset,<br />
Ran before the hooves of sunrise,<br />
<a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>Shook
thy matron tresses down in fancies<br />
Wild and wilful<br />
As a poet&rsquo;s hand could twine them;<br />
Caught in my fantasy&rsquo;s crystal chalice<br />
The Bow, as its cataract of colours<br />
Plashed to thee downward;<br />
Then when thy circuit swung to nightward,<br />
Night the abhorr&egrave;d, night was a new dawning,<br />
Celestial dawning<br />
Over the ultimate marges of the soul;<br />
Dusk grew turbulent with fire before me,<br />
And like a windy arras waved with dreams.<br />
Sleep I took not for my bedfellow,<br />
Who could waken<br />
To a revel, an inexhaustible<br />
Wassail of orgiac imageries;<br />
Then while I wore thy sore insignia<br />
In a little joy, O Earth, in a little joy;<br />
Loving thy beauty in all creatures born of thee,<br />
Children, and the sweet-essenced body of woman;<br />
Feeling not yet upon my neck thy foot,<br />
But breathing warm of thee as infants breathe<br />
New from their mother&rsquo;s morning bosom.&nbsp; So I,<br />
Risen from thee, restless winnower of the heaven,<br />
<a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>Most

My vital and resilient path, and felt<br />

From jut to jut of inaccessible fancies,<br />
In a little joy.</p>
<p class="poetry">In a little thought, in a little thought,<br />

Newly their mother&rsquo;s history, unthought<br />
Before, and say&mdash;&lsquo;She is not as we dreamed:<br />
Ah me! we are beguiled!&rsquo;&nbsp; What art thou, then,<br />
That art not our conceiving?&nbsp; Art thou not<br />
Too old for thy young children?&nbsp; Or perchance,<br />
Keep&rsquo;st thou a youth perpetual-burnishable<br />
Beyond thy sons decrepit?&nbsp; It is long<br />
Since Time was first a fledgling;<br />
Yet thou may&rsquo;st be but as a pendant bulla<br />
Against his stripling bosom swung.&nbsp; Alack!<br />
For that we seem indeed<br />
<a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>To have

These corporal leavings, thou not cast&rsquo;st us new,<br />
Fresh from thy craftship, like the lilies&rsquo; coats,<br />
But foist&rsquo;st us off<br />
With hasty tarnished piecings negligent,<br />
Snippets and waste<br />
From old ancestral wearings,<br />
That have seen sorrier usage; remainder-flesh<br />
After our father&rsquo;s surfeits; nay with chinks,<br />
Some of us, that if speech may have free leave<br />
Our souls go out at elbows.&nbsp; We are sad<br />
With more than our sires&rsquo; heaviness, and with<br />
More than their weakness weak; we shall not be<br />
Mighty with all their mightiness, nor shall not<br />
Rejoice with all their joy.&nbsp; Ay, Mother!&nbsp; Mother!<br />
What is this Man, thy darling kissed and cuffed,<br />
Thou lustingly engender&rsquo;st,<br />
To sweat, and make his brag, and rot,<br />
Crowned with all honour and all shamefulness?<br />
From nightly towers<br />
He dogs the secret footsteps of the heavens,<br />
<a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>Sifts in
his hands the stars, weighs them as gold-dust,<br />
And yet is he successive unto nothing<br />
But patrimony of a little mould,<br />
And entail of four planks.&nbsp; Thou hast made his mouth<br />
Avid of all dominion and all mightiness,<br />
All sorrow, all delight, all topless grandeurs,<br />
All beauty, and all starry majesties,<br />
And dim transtellar things;&mdash;even that it may,<br />
Filled in the ending with a puff of dust,<br />
Confess&mdash;&lsquo;It is enough.&rsquo;&nbsp; The world left
empty<br />
What that poor mouthful crams.&nbsp; His heart is builded<br />
For pride, for potency, infinity,<br />
All heights, all deeps, and all immensities,<br />
Arrased with purple like the house of kings,&mdash;<br />
To stall the grey-rat, and the carrion-worm<br />
Statelily lodge.&nbsp; Mother of mysteries!<br />
Sayer of dark sayings in a thousand tongues,<br />
Who bringest forth no saying yet so dark<br />
As we ourselves, thy darkest!&nbsp; We the young,<br />

At last confront thee, and ourselves in thee,<br />

On a mount standing, and against him stands,<br />
On the mount adverse, crowned with westering rays,<br />
The golden sun, and they two brotherly<br />
Gaze each on each;<br />
He faring down<br />
To the dull vale, his Godhead peels from him<br />
Till he can scarcely spurn the pebble&mdash;<br />
For nothingness of new-found mortality&mdash;<br />

An unrash utterance; not with flaunted hem<br />
May the Muse enter in behind the veil,<br />
Nor, though we hold the sacred dances good,<br />
Shall the holy Virgins m&aelig;nadize: ruled lips<br />
Befit a votaress Muse.<br />
Thence with no mutable, nor no gelid love,<br />
I keep, O Earth, thy worship,<br />
Though life slow, and the sobering Genius change<br />
To a lamp his gusty torch.&nbsp; What though no more <br />
Athwart its roseal glow<br />

Strange sanctities of pathos; like this knoll<br />
Made derelict of day,<br />
Couchant and shadow&egrave;d<br />
Under dim Vesper&rsquo;s overloosened hair:<br />
This, where emboss&egrave;d with the half-blown seed<br />

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Little</span> Jesus, wast
Thou shy<br />
Once, and just so small as I?<br />
And what did it feel like to be<br />
Out of Heaven, and just like me?<br />
Didst Thou sometimes think of <i>there</i>,<br />
And ask where all the angels were?<br />
I should think that I would cry<br />
For my house all made of sky;<br />

And wonder where my angels were;<br />

Not an angel there to dress me!<br />

Like us little girls and boys?<br />

With stars for marbles?&nbsp; Did the things<br />
Play <i>Can you see me</i>? through their wings?<br />

Thy robes, with playing on <i>our</i> soil?<br />
How nice to have them always new<br />
In Heaven, because &rsquo;twas quite clean blue!</p>
<p class="poetry">Didst Thou kneel at night to pray,<br />
And didst Thou join Thy hands, this way?<br />
And did they tire sometimes, being young,<br />
And make the prayer seem very long?<br />
And dost Thou like it best, that we<br />
Should join our hands to pray to Thee?<br />
I used to think, before I knew,<br />
The prayer not said unless we do.<br />
And did Thy Mother at the night<br />
Kiss Thee, and fold the clothes in right?<br />
And didst Thou feel quite good in bed,<br />
Kissed, and sweet, and thy prayers said?</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; A hap of skiey pleasure,<br />
A thought had in his cradle lain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And mingled them in measure.<br />
That chrism he laid upon his eyes,<br />
And lips, and heart, for euphrasies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That he might see, feel, sing, perdie,<br />
The simple things that are the wise.<br />
Beside the flower he held his ways,<br />
And leaned him to it gaze for gaze&mdash;<br />
He took its meaning, gaze for gaze,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As baby looks on baby;<br />
Its meaning passed into his gaze,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Native as meaning may be;<br />
He rose with all his shining gaze<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As children&rsquo;s eyes at play be.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>And</i>&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Babble</i>! <i>babble</i>!
<i>babble</i>!&rsquo; <i>said</i>;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>I&rsquo;ll tell the
whole world one day</i>!&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>There was no poet half so
glad</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Since man
grew God that Sunday</i>.</p>

CLOUD&rsquo;S SWAN-SONG</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">There</span> is a parable
in the pathless cloud,<br />
There&rsquo;s prophecy in heaven,&mdash;they did not lie,<br />
The Chaldee shepherds; seal&egrave;d from the proud,<br />
To cheer the weighted heart that mates the seeing eye.</p>
<p class="poetry">A lonely man, oppressed with lonely ills,<br />
And all the glory fallen from my song,<br />
Here do I walk among the windy hills,<br />
The wind and I keep both one monotoning tongue.</p>
<p class="poetry">Like grey clouds one by one my songs upsoar<br
/>
Over my soul&rsquo;s cold peaks; and one by one<br />
They loose their little rain, and are no more;<br />
And whether well or ill, to tell me there is none.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>For &rsquo;tis an alien tongue, of alien things,<br />
From all men&rsquo;s care, how miserably apart!<br />
Even my friends say: &lsquo;Of what is this he sings?&rsquo;<br
/>
And barren is my song, and barren is my heart.</p>
<p class="poetry">For who can work, unwitting his work&rsquo;s
worth?<br />
Better, meseems, to know the work for naught,<br />
Turn my sick course back to the kindly earth,<br />
And leave to ampler plumes the jetting tops of thought.</p>
<p class="poetry">And visitations, that do often use,<br />
Remote, unhappy, inauspicious sense<br />
Of doom, and poets widowed of their muse,<br />
And what dark &rsquo;gan, dark ended, in me did commence.</p>
<p class="poetry">I thought of spirit wronged by mortal ills,<br
/>
And my flesh rotting on my fate&rsquo;s dull stake;<br />
And how self-scorn&egrave;d they the bounty fills<br />
Of others, and the bread, even of their dearest, take.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>I thought of Keats, that died in perfect time,<br />
In predecease of his just-sickening song;<br />
Of him that set, wrapt in his radiant rhyme,<br />
Sunlike in sea.&nbsp; Life longer had been life too long.</p>
<p class="poetry">But I, exanimate of quick Poesy,&mdash;<br />
O then, no more but even a soulless corse!<br />
Nay, my Delight dies not; &rsquo;tis I should be<br />
Her dead, a stringless harp on which she had no force.</p>
<p class="poetry">Of my wild lot I thought; from place to
place,<br />
Apollo&rsquo;s song-bowed Scythian, I go on;<br />
Making in all my home, with pliant ways,<br />
But, provident of change, putting forth root in none.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now, with starved brain, sick body, patience
galled<br />
With fardels even to wincing; from fair sky<br />
Fell sudden little rain, scarce to be called<br />
A shower, which of the instant was gone wholly by.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Methinks my angel plucked my locks: I bowed<br />

&lsquo;Even so,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;even so, my brother the
good Cloud?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">It was a pilgrim of the fields of air,<br />
Its home was allwheres the wind left it rest,<br />
And in a little forth again did fare,<br />
And in all places was a stranger and a guest.</p>
<p class="poetry">It harked all breaths of heaven, and did
obey<br />
With sweet peace their uncomprehended wills;<br />
It knew the eyes of stars which made no stay,<br />
And with the thunder walked upon the lonely hills.</p>
<p class="poetry">And from the subject earth it seemed to
scorn,<br />
It drew the sustenance whereby it grew<br />
Perfect in bosom for the married Morn,<br />
And of his life and light full as a maid kissed new.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

And the long waiting for the little light,<br />
So long in life so little.&nbsp; Like a fawn<br />
It fled with tempest breathing hard at heel of flight;</p>
<p class="poetry">And having known full East, did not disdain<br
/>
To sit in shadow and oblivious cold,<br />
Save what all loss doth of its loss retain,<br />
And who hath held hath somewhat that he still must hold.</p>
<p class="poetry">Right poet! who thy rightness to approve,<br />
Having all liberty, didst keep all measure,<br />
And with a firmament for ranging, move<br />
But at the heavens&rsquo; uncomprehended pleasure.</p>
<p class="poetry">With amplitude unchecked, how sweetly thou<br
/>
Didst wear the ancient custom of the skies,<br />
And yoke of used prescription; and thence how<br />
Find gay variety no license could devise!</p>

Restraint, by the delighted search of it,<br />

<p class="poetry">Is put to fair devising in the curb<br />
Of ordered limit; and all-changeful Hermes<br />
Is Terminus as well.&nbsp; Yet we perturb<br />
Our souls for latitude, whose strength in bound and term is.</p>
<p class="poetry">How far am I from heavenly liberty,<br />
That play at policy with change and fate,<br />
Who should my soul from foreign broils keep free,<br />
In the fast-guarded frontiers of its single state!</p>
<p class="poetry">Could I face firm the Is, and with To-be<br />
Trust Heaven; to Heaven commit the deed, and do;<br />
In power contained, calm in infirmity,<br />
And fit myself to change with virtue ever new;</p>

Thou wandering kinsman, that didst sweetly live<br />
Unnoted, and unnoted sweetly die,<br />
Weeping more gracious song than any I can weave;</p>
<p class="poetry">Which these gross-tissued words do sorely
wrong.<br />
Thou hast taught me on powerlessness a power;<br />
To make song wait on life, not life on song;<br />
To hold sweet not too sweet, and bread for bread though sour;</p>
<p class="poetry">By law to wander, to be strictly free.<br />
With tears ascended from the heart&rsquo;s sad sea,<br />
Ah, such a silver song to Death could I<br />
Sing, Pain would list, forgetting Pain to be,<br />

Or rather, to my sombre thoughts replying,<br />
Of plumes funereal the thin effigies;<br />
That hour when all old dead things seem most dead,<br />
And their death instant most and most undying,<br />

The babe of an unborn calamity,<br />
Ere its due time to be deliver&egrave;d.<br />
Dead sorrow and sorrow unborn so blent their pain,<br />
That which more present was were hardly said,<br />
But both more <i>now</i> than any Now can be.<br />

The terrible mask, and the face it masked&mdash;the face you did

It has sent more souls to the unslaked Pit than it ever will draw

I damned you, girl, with my pity, who had better by far been
thwart,<br />
And drave you hard on the track to hell, because I was gentle of
heart.<br />
I shall have no comfort now in scent, no ease in dew, for
this;<br />
I shall be afraid of daffodils, and rose-buds are amiss;<br />
You have made a thing of innocence as shameful as a sin,<br />
I shall never feel a girl&rsquo;s soft arms without horror of the

My child! what was it that I sowed, that I so ill should reap?<br

From Zeus, Truth&rsquo;s sire, and maiden May&mdash;the all-<br

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Have</span> you sometimes,
calm, silent, let your tread aspirant rise<br />
Up to the mountain&rsquo;s summit, in the presence of the
skies?<br />
Was&rsquo;t on the borders of the South? or on the Bretagne
coast?<br />
And at the basis of the mount had you the Ocean tossed?<br />
And there, leaned o&rsquo;er the wave and o&rsquo;er the
immeasurableness,<br />
Calm, silent, have you harkened what it says?&nbsp; Lo, what it
says!<br />
One day at least, whereon my thought, enlicens&egrave;d to
muse,<br />
Had drooped its wing above the beach&egrave;d margent of the
ooze,<br />
<a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>And,
plunging from the mountain height into the immensity,<br />
Beheld upon one side the land, on the other side the sea.<br />
I harkened, comprehended,&mdash;never, as from those abysses,<br
/>
No, never issued from a mouth, nor moved an ear, such voice as
this is!</p>
<p class="poetry">A sound it was, at outset, vast, immeasurable,
confused,<br />
Vaguer than is the wind among the tufted trees effused,<br />
Full of magnificent accords, suave murmurs, sweet as is<br />
The evensong, and mighty as the shock of panoplies<br />
When the hoarse melee in its arms the closing squadrons grips,<br
/>
And pants, in furious breathings, from the clarions&rsquo; brazen
lips.<br />
Unutterable the harmony, unsearchable its deep,<br />
Whose fluid undulations round the world a girdle keep,<br />
<a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>And
through the vasty heavens, which by its surges are washed
young,<br />
Its infinite volutions roll, enlarging as they throng,<br />
Even to the profound arcane, whose ultimate chasms sombre<br />
Its shattered flood englut with time, with space and form and
number.<br />
Like to another atmosphere with thin o&rsquo;erflowing robe,<br
/>
The hymn eternal covers all the inundated globe:<br />
And the world, swathed about with this investuring symphony,<br
/>
Even as it trepidates in the air, so trepidates in the
harmony.</p>
<p class="poetry">And pensive, I attended the ethereal lutany,<br
/>
Lost within this containing voice as if within the sea.</p>
<p class="poetry">Soon I distinguished, yet as tone which veils
confuse and smother,<br />
Amid this voice two voices, one commingled with the other,<br />
Which did from off the land and seas even to the heavens
aspire;<br />
Chanting the universal chant in simultaneous quire.<br />
<a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>And I
distinguished them amid that deep and rumorous sound,<br />
As who beholds two currents thwart amid the fluctuous
profound.</p>
<p class="poetry">The one was of the waters; a be-radiant hymnal
speech!<br />
That was the voice o&rsquo; the surges, as they parleyed each
with each.<br />
The other, which arose from our abode terranean,<br />
Was sorrowful; and that, alack! the murmur was of man;<br />
And in this mighty quire, whose chantings day and night
resound,<br />
Every wave had its utterance, and every man his sound.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now, the magnificent Ocean, as I said,
unbannering<br />
A voice of joy, a voice of peace, did never stint to sing,<br />
Most like in Sion&rsquo;s temples to a psaltery psaltering,<br />
And to creation&rsquo;s beauty reared the great lauds of his
song.<br />
Upon the gale, upon the squall, his clamour borne along<br />
<a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>Unpausingly arose to God in more triumphal swell;<br />
And every one among his waves, that God alone can quell,<br />
When the other of its song made end, into the singing pressed.<br
/>
Like that majestic lion whereof Daniel was the guest,<br />
At intervals the Ocean his tremendous murmur awed;<br />
And I, t&rsquo;ward where the sunset fires fell shaggily and
broad,<br />
Under his golden mane, methought, that I saw pass the hand of
God.</p>
<p class="poetry">Meanwhile, and side by side with that august
fan-faronnade,<br />
The other voice, like the sudden scream of a destrier
affrayed,<br />
Like an infernal door that grates ajar its rusty throat,<br />
Like to a bow of iron that gnarls upon an iron rote,<br />
Grinded; and tears, and shriekings, the anathema, the lewd
taunt,<br />
Refusal of viaticum, refusal of the font,<br />
<a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>And
clamour, and malediction, and dread blasphemy, among<br />
That hurtling crowd of rumour from the diverse human tongue,<br
/>
Went by as who beholdeth, when the valleys thick t&rsquo;ward
night,<br />
The long drifts of the birds of dusk pass, blackening flight on
flight.<br />
What was this sound whose thousand echoes vibrated unsleeping?<br
/>
Alas! the sound was earth&rsquo;s and man&rsquo;s, for earth and
man were weeping.</p>
<p class="poetry">Brothers! of these two voices, strange most
unimaginably,<br />
Unceasingly regenerated, dying unceasingly,<br />
Harken&egrave;d of the Eternal throughout His Eternity,<br />
The one voice uttereth: <span class="smcap">Nature</span>! and
the other voice: <span class="smcap">Humanity</span>!</p>
<p class="poetry">Then I alit in reverie; for my ministering
sprite<br />
Alack! had never yet deployed a pinion of an ampler flight,<br />
<a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>Nor ever
had my shadow endured so large a day to burn:<br />
And long I rested dreaming, contemplating turn by turn<br />
Now that abyss obscure which lurked beneath the water&rsquo;s
roll,<br />
And now that other untemptable abyss which opened in my soul.<br
/>
And I made question of me, to what issues are we here,<br />
Whither should tend the thwarting threads of all this ravelled
gear;<br />
What doth the soul; to be or live if better worth it is;<br />
And why the Lord, Who, only, reads within that book of His,<br />
In fatal hymeneals hath eternally entwined<br />
The vintage-chant of nature with the dirging cry of
humankind?</p>

Hear, thou slave Fame, while Time endures,<br />
I give her thee;<br />

Take her, the thrall is yours.</p>

<p class="poetry">A <span class="smcap">boy&rsquo;s</span> young
fancy taketh love<br />
Most simply, with the rind thereof;<br />
A boy&rsquo;s young fancy tasteth more<br />
The rind, than the deific core.<br />
Ah, Sweet! to cast away the slips<br />
Of unessential rind, and lips<br />
Fix on the immortal core, is well;<br />
But heard&rsquo;st thou ever any tell<br />
Of such a fool would take for food<br />
Aspect and scent, however good,<br />
Of sweetest core Love&rsquo;s orchards grow?<br />
Should such a phantast please him so,<br />
Love where Love&rsquo;s reverent self denies<br />
Love to feed, but with his eyes,<br />
All the savour, all the touch,<br />
Another&rsquo;s&mdash;was there ever such?<br />
Such were fool, if fool there be;<br />
Such fool was I, and was for thee!<br />
<a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>But if
the touch and savour too<br />
Of this fruit&mdash;say, Sweet, of you&mdash;<br />
You unto another give<br />
For sacrosanct prerogative,<br />
Yet even scent and aspect were<br />
Some elected Second&rsquo;s share;<br />
And one, gone mad, should rest content<br />
With memory of show and scent;<br />
Would not thyself vow, if there sigh<br />
Such a fool&mdash;say, Sweet, as I&mdash;<br />
Treble frenzy it must be<br />
Still to love, and to love thee?</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet had I torn (man knoweth not,<br />
Nor scarce the unweeping angels wot<br />
Of such dread task the lightest part)<br />
Her fingers from about my heart.<br />
Heart, did we not think that she<br />
Had surceased her tyranny?<br />
Heart, we bounded, and were free!<br />
O sacrilegious freedom!&mdash;Till<br />
She came, and taught my apostate will<br />
The winnowed sweet mirth cannot guess<br />
And tear-fined peace of hopefulness;<br />

Now old pain is fresh content,<br />
Proved content is unproved pain.<br />
Pangs fore-tempted, which in vain<br />
I, faithless, have denied, now bud<br />
To untempted fragrance and the mood<br />
Of contrite heavenliness; all days<br />
Joy affrights me in my ways;<br />
Extremities of old delight<br />
Afflict me with new exquisite<br />
Virgin piercings of surprise,&mdash;<br />
Stung by those wild brown bees, her eyes!</p>

Sad Love in life, sore Love in agony,<br />
Pale Love in death; while all his offspring songs,<br />
Like children, versed not in death&rsquo;s chilly wrongs,<br />
About him flit, frighted to see him lie<br />
So still, who did not know that Love could die.<br />
One lifts his wing, where dulls the vermeil all<br />
Like clotting blood, and shrinks to find it cold,<br />
And when she sees its lapse and nerveless fall<br />
Clasps her fans, while her sobs ooze through the webb&egrave;d
gold.<br />
Thereat all weep together, and their tears<br />
Make lights like shivered moonlight on long waters.<br />
Have peace, O piteous daughters!<br />
He shall not wake more through the mortal years,<br />

Above myself, and that I might not be<br />

Since Love that first did wing, now clogged me from the sky.<br

Yet lofty Love being dead thus passeth base&mdash;<br />
There is a soul of nobleness which stays,<br />
The spectre of the rose: be comforted,<br />
Songs, for the dust that dims his sacred head!<br />
The days draw on too dark for Song or Love;<br />
O peace, my songs, nor stir ye any wing!<br />
For lo, the thunder hushing all the grove,<br />
And did Love live, not even Love could sing.</p>
<p class="poetry">And, Lady, thus I dare to say,<br />
Not all with you is passed away!<br />
For your love taught me this:&mdash;&rsquo;tis Love&rsquo;s true

To be, not staff, but writ of worthy days;<br />
And that high worth in love unfortunate<br />
Should still remain it learned in love elate.<br />
Beyond your star, still, still the stars are bright;<br />

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
